Setup:

Use the `flake.nix` from this folder (for HC 0.2.2), copied into a scaffolded Holochain app (replace the 0.1.x flake.nix). In that folder, run `nix develop`.

Once you are in your nix environment, cd into this directory, ensuring first `pnpm` is installed globally.

- `pnpm i`

- `pnpm start`
